                    <h2><b>Tekst piosenki:</b></h2><br>
                        A lovestruck Romeo<br>
                        Sings the streets a serenade<br>
                        Laying everybody low<br>
                        With a love song that he made<br>
                        Finds the streetlight<br>
                        Steps out of the shade<br>
                        Says something like:<br>
                        "You and me, babe, how about it?"<br>
                        <br>
                        Juliet says: "Hey it's Romeo,<br>
                        You nearly gave me a heart attack"<br>
                        He's underneath the window<br>
                        She's singing: "Hey la my boyfriend's back<br>
                        You shoudn't come around here<br>
                        Singing up at people like that<br>
                        Anyway, what you gonna do about it?"<br>
                        <br>
                        Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start<br>
                        And I bet and you exploded in my heart<br>
                        And I forget, I forget the movie song<br>
                        When you gonna realise<br>
                        It was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?<br>
                        <br>
                        Come up on different streets<br>
                        They both were streets of shame<br>
                        Both dirty, both mean<br>
                        Yes and the dream was just the same<br>
                        And I dreamed your dream for you<br>
                        And now your dream is real<br>
                        How can you look at me<br>
                        As if I was just another one of your deals?<br>
                        <br>
                        When you can fall for chains of silver<br>
                        You can fall for chains of gold<br>
                        You can fall for pretty strangers<br>
                        And the promises they hold<br>
                        You promised me everything<br>
                        You promised me thick and thin, yeah<br>
                        Now you just say  "Oh, Romeo, yeah<br>
                        You know I used to have a scene with him"<br>
                        <br>
                        Juliet, when we made love you used to cry<br>
                        You said: "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die<br>
                        There's a place for us, you know the movie song<br>
                        When you gonna realise<br>
                        It was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?<br>
                        <br>
                        I can't do the talks<br>
                        Like they talk on the tv<br>
                        And I can't do a love song<br>
                        Like the way it's meant to be<br>
                        I can't do everything<br>
                        But I'd do anything for you<br>
                        I can't do anything except being in love with you<br>
                        <br>
                        And all I do is miss you<br>
                        And the way we used to be<br>
                        All I do is keep the beat<br>
                        The bad company<br>
                        All I do is kiss you<br>
                        Through the bars of a rhyme<br>
                        Juliet I'd do the stars with you any time<br>
                        <br>
                        Juliet, when we made love you used to cry<br>
                        You said: "I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die"<br>
                        There's a place for us, you know the movie song<br>
                        When you gonna realise<br>
                        It was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?<br>
                        <br>
                        A lovestruck Romeo<br>
                        Sings the streets a serenade<br>
